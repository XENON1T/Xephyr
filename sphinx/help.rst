How to get Help
================

The best way to get help is to contact the developers, and the reccomended way is to file a question or an issue (if you think is a bug) in the 
`github issue page`_. 

If it is a question about how to use the package or about an error, please write  **[Question]** in the title. 
We will collect there all the questions so that at some point (hopefully) we can use it as FAQ.
