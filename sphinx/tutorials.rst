Examples of Packages
---------------------

There is a plan to provide several code examples as Xephyr packages, they are under construction and will be posted on this page. 
If you write a package for your analysis we'd like to post here a link to your code.

**Noticeable code examples:**

- `SR1 Xephyr likelihood package`_
