Tutorials and Examples 
=======================

Notebook Tutorials
-------------------

You can find the HTML version of the following ROOT jupyter notebooks here:

- `tutorial likelihood`_
- `tutorial toy generation`_
- `tutorial toy fitting and limits`_


.. _`tutorial likelihood`: https://github.com/XENON1T/Xephyr/blob/master/notebooks/likelihood_setup_example.ipynb 
.. _`tutorial toy generation`: https://github.com/XENON1T/Xephyr/blob/master/notebooks/ToyGenerator_example.ipynb
.. _`tutorial toy fitting and limits`: https://github.com/XENON1T/Xephyr/blob/master/notebooks/ToyFitter.ipynb


Examples of Packages
---------------------

There is a plan to provide several code examples as Xephyr packages, they are under construction and will be posted on this page. 
If you write a package for your analysis we'd like to post here a link to your code.

**Xephyr supported Examples**

- `1D likelihood example:`_ how to "hack" Xephyr to feed 1D data and models to a 2D likelihood. 


**Noticeable code examples (from other authors):**

- `SR1 Xephyr likelihood package`_
- `Inelastic Dark Matter`_

.. _`SR1 Xephyr likelihood package`: https://github.com/XENON1T/SR1Results/tree/master/StatisticalAnalyses/xephyr_sr1_likelihood
